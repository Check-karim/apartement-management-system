### Development Commands
```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run start    # Start production server
npm run lint     # Run ESLint
```

## üöÄ Deployment

### Environment Setup
1. Set up production MySQL database
2. Update environment variables for production
3. Change default admin password
4. Configure domain and SSL certificates

### Build and Deploy
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

### Environment Variables (Production)
```env
DB_HOST=your-production-host
DB_USER=your-production-user
DB_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-very-secure-secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

## üîí Security Considerations

- Change default admin credentials immediately
- Use strong, unique passwords for database and NextAuth secret
- Enable SSL/HTTPS in production
- Regularly update dependencies
- Monitor database access and logs
- Implement proper backup strategies
